Explanation: 
The comment tag is used to insert comments in the source code. Comments are not displayed in the browsers.
You can use comments to explain your code, which can help you when you edit the source code at a later date. This is especially useful if you have a lot of code.

 Usage:
 We have to start the comment by "<!--" and end it by "-->". Or we can just select the part we want to comment out and press "CTRL + /"
